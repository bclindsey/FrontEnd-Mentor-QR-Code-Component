### What I learned

This project was extremely useful for my learning. I have been going through freeCodeCamp's fullstack course for the last 8 months off and on and have finally wrapped up the html and css portions and am a fourth of the way through the JavaScript section. I felt I needed more practical, hands on experience with CSS specifically, so I looked around online and I found FrontEnd Mentor.

I realized that although I got really good at knowing how to solve the problems fCC gives me for labs and workshops, I was training myself to follow a bullet point list of instructions rather than take a picture of a design and make it myself. This project humbled me a bit as it was fairly small in scope and yet there were parts I struggled on. I realized that although I know roughly when to use grid and flexbox, I am not yet fluent at them. This project was good practice for that and I am happy to have done it.

There is not too much from the HTML that I am proud of as that was fairly straight forward but from the CSS I enjoyed making my custom properties. That was something I recently learned about through fCC.

```css
:root {
  --white: hsl(0, 0%, 100%);
  --slate-300: hsl(212, 45%, 89%);
  --slate-500: hsl(216, 15%, 48%);
  --slate-900: hsl(218, 44%, 22%);
  --blue-background: #d6e0f0;
}
```

### Continued development

As stated earlier, flexbox and grid are two areas I need more practice in. I want to get so comfortable positioning components on a website that it becomes second nature. That way, in the future, when I have a vision for how a website should look, I can quickly mock up an outline of the site and add more detail throughout the project. My main concern right now is mastering CSS so that tailwind becomes less of a pain in the future. I want my learning experience with tailwind to be about the syntax rather than the logic behind styling. That is what learning CSS is for.
